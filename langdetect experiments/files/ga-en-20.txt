I woke up feeling refreshed this morning.
Bhí áthas orm nuair a chonaic mé an aimsir bhreá.
The sun was shining through my bedroom window.
I stretched and got out of bed slowly.
My plan for today was simple and relaxing.
First, I would make a nice breakfast.
Then perhaps I would visit my friend downtown.
Bhaineoinn sult as cupán caife i gcaifé deas.
The afternoon could be spent reading or walking.
It felt good to have no urgent tasks today.
