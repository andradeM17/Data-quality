{"text": "I was playing normal, just got into an alliance. Oops, now I’m not getting any MP! Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!” The message repeats every time I hit enter. What the fuck! I’m not cheating. Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock. Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever. It tells me to turn off then refresh. I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player. 10/10 I’m never playing again. Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens."}

{"text": "My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night, catch up on our lives evening.  We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night.  Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this.  My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her.  They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours.  I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn't budge.  Times are hard, I know, but they had no compassion.  I called 3 times to talked to a manager, never a call back.  I emailed 4 times, never a response.  In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet's that expressed their sympathy, this hotel did nothing.  I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing.  I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews, but if something unexpected happens in your life, they will not care."}
{"text": "BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER!!!  It was the best Chinese food I have ever had.  All the food tasted excellent, and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom, it is awesome.  The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly.  Every time I go, Kevin, the manager, will always remember my family and I.  Overall, it is very family oriented, and I recommend it to everyone!!!"}
{"text": "When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11, I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager, Gustavo Guerra, in a very friendly and professional manner.  I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda.  Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle.  He told me "no problem, we will match the offer or do better."  Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems.  Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world.  I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus!!!  Excellent customer service!!!"}
{"text": "The Worst Chinese I've Ever Had  This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had.  The service stunk.  I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up, they got my order confused with someone elses.  They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again.  They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $10 more than what she had wanted.  She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead.  We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order.  Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull.  They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up.  We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible.  I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken, sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that.  The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable.  I will NEVER go here again.  Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal.  I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote."}
{"text": "Poor Service, Lack of Passion: Do NOT go  I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care, patient-doctor communication, and just the overall level of services.  The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office.  It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task, and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion (not that it's a requirement for the job, but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful).  Also, I was promised to have my test results emailed to me, but it never happened, and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition, I finally gave up and went to a different doctor.  Please do not go there if it's professional, friendly, diligent medical services you're looking for.  Save yourself the trouble, money and time and visit a more caring facility/doctor."}
{"text": "Terrible service!!!  Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate.  They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate.  When I called the manager to complain, she said she KNEW the guy didn't know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier!  Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead.  So what was the point of the appointment!?!  To just come over and hang out?!?  I will NEVER do business with this company!  EVER!!!"}
{"text": "Beware of Sharayu  Hopless service, at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised.  Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint.  My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you dont!!!"}
{"text": "Don't waste your time or money!  I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest, apart from the shark walkway, I thought it was rubbish and overpriced.  Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round, it took us just over one hour start to finish.  If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this.  If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £30 for 2 two people then go for it.  (For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me!)"}
